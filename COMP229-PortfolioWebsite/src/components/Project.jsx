It's a React web app where you can upload any picture and apply filters that mimic various visual impairments. It's a powerful way to get a glimpse into how people with different visual challenges see the world. All in real-time, all to help us understand and empathize better.",

Inspired by the valorant agent, this bot offers an economy system where users can save up virtual cash to try their luck with games like roulette, blackjack, and slots. JettBot also offers random agent picks and a gacha system for Valorant skins. JettBot also functions as a musicbot! I built this single-guild bot for fun and is now used by over 150 people in my discord server.",
